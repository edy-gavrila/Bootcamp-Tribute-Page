              Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck FRS (23 April 1858 – 4 October 1947)
              was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy
              quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.

              Planck made many substantial contributions to theoretical physics,
              but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the
              originator of quantum theory, which revolutionized human
              understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. In 1948, the
              German scientific institution Kaiser Wilhelm Society (of which
              Planck was twice president) was renamed Max Planck Society (MPG).
              The MPG now includes 83 institutions representing a wide range of
              scientific directions.

              In 1864 - the family moved to Munich, and Planck enrolled in the
              Maximilians gymnasium school, where he came under the tutelage of
              Hermann Müller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth,
              and taught him astronomy and mechanics as well as mathematics. It
              was from Müller that Planck first learned the principle of
              conservation of energy. Planck graduated early, at age 17. This is
              how Planck first came in contact with the field of physics.

              In 1877 - he went to the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Berlin
              for a year of study with physicists Hermann von Helmholtz and
              Gustav Kirchhoff and mathematician Karl Weierstrass. He wrote that
              Helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated
              endlessly, and bored his listeners, while Kirchhoff spoke in
              carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. He soon
              became close friends with Helmholtz. While there he undertook a
              program of mostly self-study of Clausius's writings, which led him
              to choose thermodynamics as his field.
            </p>
            <p class="text-para">
              In 1878 - Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879
              defended his dissertation, Über den zweiten Hauptsatz der
              mechanischen Wärmetheorie (On the second law of thermodynamics).
              He briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in
              Munich.

              In 1880 - By this year, Planck had obtained the two highest
              academic degrees offered in Europe. The first was a doctorate
              degree after he completed his paper detailing his research and
              theory of thermodynamics. He then presented his thesis called
              Gleichgewichtszustände isotroper Körper in verschiedenen
              Temperaturen (Equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different
              temperatures), which earned him a habilitation.

              As a professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin,
              Planck joined the local Physical Society. He later wrote about
              this time: "In those days I was essentially the only theoretical
              physicist there, whence things were not so easy for me, because I
              started mentioning entropy, but this was not quite fashionable,
              since it was regarded as a mathematical spook". Thanks to his
              initiative, the various local Physical Societies of Germany merged
              in 1898 to form the German Physical Society (Deutsche
              Physikalische Gesellschaft, DPG); from 1905 to 1909 Planck was the
              president.

              Planck started a six-semester course of lectures on theoretical
              physics, "dry, somewhat impersonal" according to Lise Meitner,
              "using no notes, never making mistakes, never faltering; the best
              lecturer I ever heard" according to an English participant, James
              R. Partington, who continues: "There were always many standing
              around the room. As the lecture-room was well heated and rather
              close, some of the listeners would from time to time drop to the
              floor, but this did not disturb the lecture."

              In 1894, Planck turned his attention to the problem of black-body
              radiation. The problem had been stated by Kirchhoff in 1859: "how
              does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a
              black body (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator)
              depend on the frequency of the radiation (i.e., the color of the
              light) and the temperature of the body?". Work on this particular
              problem led him to derive his famous Planck constant, h. The
              discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new
              universal set of physical units (such as the Planck length and the
              Planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon
              which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of Planck's
              fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was
              awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918 (he actually received
              the award in 1919).

            <p class="text-para">
              In 1905, the three epochal papers by Albert Einstein were
              published in the journal Annalen der Physik. Planck was among the
              few who immediately recognized the significance of the special
              theory of relativity. Thanks to his influence, this theory was
              soon widely accepted in Germany. Planck also contributed
              considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. For
              example, he recast the theory in terms of classical action.
            </p>
            <p class="text-para">
              Einstein's hypothesis of light quanta (photons), based on Heinrich
              Hertz's 1887 discovery (and further investigation by Philipp
              Lenard) of the photoelectric effect, was initially rejected by
              Planck. He was unwilling to discard completely Maxwell's theory of
              electrodynamics. "The theory of light would be thrown back not by
              decades, but by centuries, into the age when Christiaan Huygens
              dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of Isaac Newton

              In 1910, Einstein pointed out the anomalous behavior of specific
              heat at low temperatures as another example of a phenomenon which
              defies explanation by classical physics. Planck and Nernst,
              seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions,
              organized the First Solvay Conference (Brussels 1911). At this
              meeting Einstein was able to convince Planck.

            <p class="text-para">
              Meanwhile, Planck had been appointed dean of Berlin University,
              whereby it was possible for him to call Einstein to Berlin and
              establish a new professorship for him (1914). Soon the two
              scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music
              together.

              At the onset of the First World War Planck endorsed the general
              excitement of the public, writing that, "Besides much that is
              horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and
              beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic
              political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the
              extolling of everything good and noble." Planck also signed the
              infamous "Manifesto of the 93 intellectuals", a pamphlet of
              polemic war propaganda (while Einstein retained a strictly
              pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, only
              being spared thanks to his Swiss citizenship).

              In 1915, when Italy was still a neutral power, he voted
              successfully for a scientific paper from Italy, which received a
              prize from the Prussian Academy of Sciences, where Planck was one
              of four permanent presidents.
            </p>
            <p class="text-para">
              In the turbulent post-war years, Planck, now the highest authority
              of German physics, issued the slogan "persevere and continue
              working" to his colleagues.
            </p>
            <p class="text-para">
              In October 1920, he and Fritz Haber established the
              Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (Emergency Organization
              of German Science), aimed at providing financial support for
              scientific research. A considerable portion of the money the
              organization would distribute was raised abroad.

              When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was 74. He witnessed
              many Jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions
              and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrate from Nazi
              Germany. Again he tried to "persevere and continue working" and
              asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in
              Germany. Nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist
              Hermann Kranold, to emigrate to London after his arrest. He hoped
              the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would
              improve.

              Otto Hahn asked Planck to gather well-known German professors in
              order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of
              Jewish professors, but Planck replied, "If you are able to gather
              today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and
              speak against it, because they are eager to take over the
              positions of the others." Under Planck's leadership, the Kaiser
              Wilhelm Society (KWG) avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime,
              except concerning the Jewish Fritz Haber. Planck tried to discuss
              the issue with the recently appointed Chancellor of Germany Adolf
              Hitler, but was unsuccessful, as to Hitler "the Jews are all
              Communists, and these are my enemies." In the following year,
              1934, Haber died in exile.

            <p class="text-para">
              One year later, Planck, having been the president of the KWG since
              1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official
              commemorative meeting for Haber. He also succeeded in secretly
              enabling a number of Jewish scientists to continue working in
              institutes of the KWG for several years. In 1936, his term as
              president of the KWG ended, and the Nazi government pressured him
              to refrain from seeking another term.

              As the political climate in Germany gradually became more hostile,
              Johannes Stark, prominent exponent of Deutsche Physik ("German

              and Heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of Einstein,
              calling them "white Jews". The "Hauptamt Wissenschaft" (Nazi
              government office for science) started an investigation of
              Planck's ancestry, claiming that he was "1/16 Jewish", but Planck
              himself denied it.

              In 1944 Planck's son Erwin was arrested by the Gestapo following
              the attempted assassination of Hitler in the 20 July plot. He was
              tried and sentenced to death by the People's Court in October
              1944. Erwin was hanged at Berlin's Plötzensee Prison in January
              1945. The death of his son destroyed much of Planck's will to
              live. After the end of the war Planck, his second wife, and his
              son by her were brought to a relative in Göttingen, where Planck
              died on 4 October 1947. His grave is situated in the old
              Stadtfriedhof (City Cemetery) in Göttingen.
